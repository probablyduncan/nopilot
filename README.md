so what's my plan

so I need a landing page with:
- text input
- list of example queries
- maybe chat history? that can come later

and the backend needs:
- endpoint to accept queries
- something to be able to respond


types of responses:

completely random (this response is always an option)
input conditional (this input means this response is an option)
required based on input (this input will always result in this response)
