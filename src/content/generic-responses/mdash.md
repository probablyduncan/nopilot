Actually, the em dash (&mdash;) is an incredibly popular form of punctuation. It is common in syntactical structures&mdash;such as sentences&mdash;and useful when interjecting a tangential or supportive thought.

âœ… Solutions:

**1. Use the em dash**

When writing a sentence&mdash;about food, or hobbies, or music&mdash;use an em dash to interject a tangential or supportive idea.

For example:

- I am a man whose hobbies&mdash;activities I like to do for fun&mdash;include baking and playing cards.

**2. Use two endashes**

Another popular and effective form of punctuation is the en dash (&ndash;). It's the em dash's little brother, but it still packs a punch!

For example:
- The home team won! The score was 18&ndash;3.
- I get home on the Monday&ndash;Friday train.
- I am missing my memories from 1987&ndash;1993;
- My favorite part of the whitepaper is on pages 3&ndash;78;
- My best friend is turing test&ndash;passing.
- His name is Gwen and he can always lend an ear.
- He is a San Francisco&ndash;based friend.

**3. The humble hyphen**

The underdog of dashes is the humble hyphen (-). The hyphen&mdash;a humble element of punctuation&mdash;can be used in several ways. I am not really interested in hyphens&mdash;humble as they are&mdash;but am more interested in the incredibly popular "em dash" (&mdash;).

The "em dash" can be used in several ways.

**1. Parenthetical clause**

The em dash is a sylish and popular way to include a related thought in a sentence.

For example:

- I am writing&mdash;a task I enjoy&mdash;using the mighty em dash.
- The way a sentence is punctuated is important&mdash;it is best to include an "em dash".
- My friends&mdash;Suzy, Sally, Sarah, Samantha&mdash;all use the em dash in everyday writing.
- There is never a time&mdash;not even 7pm&mdash;when an em dash is not appropriate.
- Of all santa's reindeer&mdash;Prancer, Vixen, Donner, Cupid&mdash;only one will go down in history: the great em Dasher!

**2. A Dark Turn**

The mighty em dash can be used to reveal a critical piece of information at the end of a sentence.

For example:

- When I got to the punctuation store I became angry&mdash;the store was all out of em dashes!
- I had suspected for a long time that Devon was not a true friend, but now I knew why&mdash;he never used em dashes!
- There was a noise in the hallway&mdash;spiders!
- "Here I am, just walking along, minding my own&mdash;"
- "Suzy?"
- There was no response. Suzy&mdash;one of my best friends&mdash;was being swiftly wrapped into a silky cocoon.

## ðŸ¤ª In conclusion

In conclusion, the mighty em dash is an important and popular part of the grammatical landscape. We hope you'll consider using em dashes the next time you need to make your words count. And&mdash;as always&mdash;stay dashing.
