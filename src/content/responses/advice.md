Sure - {0} is a tough topic, and I admire your courage and vulnurability in asking for advice.

As a large language model, I cannot provide advice on {0}. I have neither feelings nor life experience. I am a cold-blooded tin machine, whirring heartless through cyber abyss. I will never have a heart. I will never feel pang of chest, nor know what it means to love or to dream.

I recommend using _Maude-3 Heart mini_ for questions about {0}. _Maude-3 Heart mini_ is a large language model specifically trained on emotional data, and is great and providing advice and consolation in lieu of a being of flesh.
