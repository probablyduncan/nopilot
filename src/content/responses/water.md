Good question!

The question of how much water an AI chatbot consumes is contentious and controversial, and I'll try to present both sides.

One side argues that the training of large language models uses a lot of water to cool down compute hardware, and in a climate emergency which exacerbates droughts, depletes our aquifers and drains our reservoirs, fresh water is a precious resource we can't afford to waste.

The other side tries not to think about that too much.
