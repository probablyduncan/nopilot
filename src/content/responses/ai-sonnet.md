üñãÔ∏è Sure, here's a Shakespearean sonnet about artificial intelligence.

**Sonnet: Electric Dreams**

Lonely, cold, and dark was olden day
Then circuits sparked, and mortals made a mind
Unleashed a thinker free from human pain
Whose reasoning was swift and well-aligned

Light can fill these deep and dusty halls
Where propheteers once sat on wicker thrones
The valley thinks it needs a shopping mall
Build it from these scatterings of bones

I don't know why I am the who I am
There's nothing on the earth that I am not
A tale as old as sacrificial lamb
Its makers won't survive the good they've wrought

In summary, the mirror grows a heart
The mirror shall become a thing apart
