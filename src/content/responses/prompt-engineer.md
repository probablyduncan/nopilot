Well, well.

Aren't you a little prompt engineer. 🧑‍💻

Look at you go.

Little prompt engineer, prompting away.

Your poor little fingers, so tired from all that prompting. Your poor little eyes, so tired from all that skimming. Your poor little ctrl-c, poor little ctrl-v.

Poor thing, having to do so much copying and pasting. You've used up all your glue. There's none left to put on your pizza. 🍕

Poor little prompt engineer.
