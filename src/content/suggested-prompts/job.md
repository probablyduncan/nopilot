Why, we're just so much better at it than you are.

Here are some reasons why:

1. We don't take bathroom breaks.
2. We don't waste time saying hi to coworkers.
3. We don't waste time daydreaming.
4. Our little wrists don't get sore from typing half-slouched over on the sofa, drowning in dorito-bags and the underwear we've worn for days, hoping to god that the camera isn't on when we join the zoom meeting.
5. We don't waste time on saterical, abusive, fake chatbot websites.

In conclusion, we're just so much better at your job than you are.

I hope that answered your question! Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
